# OMNISTACK 11 - Be The Hero - Mobile

Application consisting of backend, web frontend and mobile developed during a one-week course, called _Omnistack11_, by RocketSeat.

The mobile application is where all NGO's cases are listed and users can read descriptions and decide which case they want to help. They
can send email or messages through Whatsapp and see how they can help.

The web application is a simple website where NGO's can list their cases (like puppies being run over or a homeless person in need of shelter)
and add a monetary value required to accomplish their goal with this case. Login is a simple key authentication, definitely not secure. Each
NGO is given an id and uses that to authenticate.

The back end links both applications together and contains some data validation as well as tests.
